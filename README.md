## Work In Progress for a scientific publication

Create random boolean matrices that maintain row and column sums. This is a very
common use case for null models in ecology.

The package offers the newest and most efficient unbiased algorithms for generating
random matrices. Legacy approaches have used different forms of swapping, or some
alternative approaches like the `quasiswap` algorithm in R's vegan package. These
methods are neither efficient, nor are they guaranteed to sample the possible
distribution of boolean vectors with a given row and column sum equally.

Currently, the package only offers an implementation of the `curveball` algorithm
of Strona et al. (2014). There are two forms: a `randomize_matrix!` function
that will randomize a sparse boolean `Matrix` in-place, and a generator form:

```julia
using SparseArrays, RandomBooleanMatrices

# in-place
m = sprand(Bool, 1000, 1000, 0.1)
randomize_matrix!(m)

# using a Matrix generator object
m = sprand(Bool, 1000, 1000, 0.1)
rmg = matrixrandomizer(m)
m1 = rand(rmg) # creates a new random matrix
m2 = rand(rmg)

# You can also avoid copying by
m3 = rand!(rmg)
# but notice that this will not create a new copy of the Matrix, so generating multiple matrices at once with this is impossible
```
